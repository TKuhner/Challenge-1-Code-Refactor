# Challenge-1-Code-Refactor
Repo is intended for the use of Trevor Kuhner's Completion of Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp Challenge 1: Code Refactor.

For challenge 1, we were provided HTML and CSS files and were to refactor code that is essentially redundant code. Goal is to perform this while ensuring that the web page is still functional and maintain the same formatting.

Screen shots of web page have been added to assets folder
